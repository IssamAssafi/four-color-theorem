# four-color-theorem - Implementation

## Description

The four-color theorem states that any map in a plane can be colored using four-colors in such a way that regions sharing a common boundary (other than a single point) do not share the same color. This problem is sometimes also called Guthrie's problem after F. Guthrie, who first conjectured the theorem in 1852.

This project is a C implementation of this theorem, using both both greedy and backtrack algorithms based on the four color theorem, the application concerns Morocco's and Africa's Map.
